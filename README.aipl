    # AIPL (Array-Inspired Pipeline Language)

    [![Tests](https://github.com/saulpw/aipl/workflows/aipl-testing/badge.svg)](https://github.com/saulpw/aipl/actions/workflows/main.yml)
    [![discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/880915750007750737?label=discord)](https://visidata.org/chat)

    A tiny DSL to make it easier to explore and experiment with AI pipelines.

    ## Features

    - array language semantics (implicit looping over input)
    - tacit dataflow (output from previous command becomes input to next command)
    - entire pipeline defined in same file and in execution order for better understanding
      - including inline prompt templates
    - persistent cache of expensive operations into a sqlite db

    ### `summarize.aipl`

    Here's a prime example, a multi-level summarizer in the "map-reduce" style of langchain:

    ```
    {summarize_aipl}
    ```

    ## Usage

    ```
    {stdout}
    ```

    ## Command Syntax

    This is the basic syntax:

    - comments start with `#` as the first character of a line, and ignore the whole line.
    - commands start with `!` as the first character of a line.
    - everything else is part of the prompt template for the previous `!` command.

    Commands can take positional and/or keyword arguments, separated by whitespace.

    - `!cmd arg1 key=value arg2`

    Keyword arguments have an `=` between the key and the value, and non-keyword arguments are those without a `=` in them.

    - `!cmd` will call the Python function registered to the `cmd` operator with the arguments given, as an operator on the current value.

    - Any text following the command line is dedented (and stripped) and added verbatim as a `prompt=` keyword argument.
    - Argument values may include Python formatting like `{{input}}` which will be replaced by values from the current row (falling back to parent rows, and ultimately the provided globals).
    - Prompt values, on the other hand, are not automatically formatted. `!format` go over every leaf row and return the formatted prompt as its output.
    - !literal will set its prompt as the toplevel input, without formatting.

    The AIPL syntax will continue to evolve and be clarified over time as it's used and developed.

    Notes:

    - an AIPL source file documents an entire pipeline from newline-delimited inputs on stdin (or via `!literal`) to the end of the pipeline (often `!print`).
    - commands always run consecutively and across all inputs.
    - the initial input is a single string (read from stdin).

    ## Defining a new operator

    It's pretty easy to define a new operator that can be used right away.
    For instance, here's how the `!join` operator might be defined:

    ```
    @defop('join', rankin=1, rankout=0)
    def op_join(aipl:AIPL, v:List[str], sep=' ') -> str:
        'Concatenate text values with *sep* into a single string.'
        return sep.join(v)
    ```

    - `@defop(...)` registers the decorated function as the named operator.
       - `rankin`/`rankout` indicate what the function takes as input, and what it returns:
         - `0`: a scalar (number or string)
         - `0.5`: a whole row (a mapping of key/value pairs)
         - `1`: a vector of scalar values (e.g. `List[str]` as above)
         - `1.5`: a whole Table (list of the whole table (array of rows)
         - `None`: nothing (the operator is an input "source" if rankin is None; it is a pass-through if rankout is None)
       - `arity` is how many operands it takes (only `0` and `1` supported currently)

    The join operator is `rankin=1 rankout=0` which means that it takes a list of strings and outputs a single string.

    - Add the `@expensive` decorator to operators that actually go to the network or use an LLM; this will persistently cache the results in a local sqlite database.
       - running the same inputs through a pipeline multiple times won't keep refetching the same data impolitely, and won't run up a large bill during development.

    ## Design

    AIPL is intended as a simple platform for quick proof of concept data pipelines to be implemented and tested.

    ## Why?

    The recent developments in LLMs and AI are a whole new level of capabilities (and costs).
    I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I tried to do some basic things with [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) but it was this big complicated system.
    So instead I implemented some small workflows myself with raw Python, and it turned out that AI is actually pretty straightforward.
    This is just a small hackable platform that makes it easy to experiment and get small-scale results.
    For now it's called AIPL.

    ### Emphasize the Dataflow

    An AIPL script represents the essence of a data pipeline, with only the high-level operations and their parameters and prompts.
    No boilerplate or quoting or complicated syntax.
    Not even much of a language--just commands executed in order.
    This keeps the focus on data flow and the high-level operations--the actual links in the chain.
    It can be expanded or optimized or parallelized as needed.

    ### Very Little Overhead

    AIPL is array-oriented and concatenative, drawing inspiration from APL and Forth, both of which have powerful operators and very simple syntax.
    Passing data implicitly between operators allows for efficient representation of data flows, and avoids [one of the hardest problems in computer science](https://www.namingthings.co/).
    And the implicit looping of array languages makes it easier to scale interactivity.

    ### Take Advantage of Python Ecosystem

    AIPL is also intended to be practical (if only at small scale), so operators are easy to write using the existing cadre of Python libraries, and allow options and parameters passed to them verbatim.

    ### Keep It Simple

    The implementation is intentionally homespun, to remove layers of abstraction and reduce the friction of setup and operation.
    It doesn't parallelize anything yet but it still should be able to handle hundreds of items even as it is, enough to prove a concept.
    I expect it to be straightforward to scale it to mag 5 (up to a million items) if something takes off.

    ### Learn and Explore

    At the very least, AIPL should be a useful tool to learn, explore, and prototype small-scale data pipelines that have expensive operations like API calls and LLM generation.


    # Architecture

    The fundamental data structure is a Table: an array of hashmaps ("rows"), with named Columns that key into each Row to get its value.

    A value can be a string or a number or another Table.

    The value of a row is the value in the rightmost column of its table.
    The rightmost column of a table is a vector of values representing the whole table.

    A simple vector has only strings or numbers.
    A simple table has a simple rightmost value vector and is Rank 0.
    Each nesting of tables in the rightmost value vector increases its Rank by 1.

    ## operators
    Each operator consumes 0 or 1 or 2 operands (its `arity`), and produces one result, which becomes the operand for the next operator.

    Each operator has an "in rank" and an "out rank", which is the rank of the operands they input and output.

    By default, each operator is applied across the deepest nested table.
    The result of each operator is then placed in the deepest nested table (or its parent).

    ### rankin=0: one scalar at a time

    With `rankin=0` and `rankout` of:

    - -1: no change (like 'print')
    - 0: scalar operation (like 'translate')
    - 0.5: scalar to simple row (like 'url-split')
    - 1: scalar to simple vector (like 'split-text')
    - 1.5: scalar to table (like 'extract-links')

    ### rankin=0.5: consume whole row

    With `rankin=0.5`, and `rankout` of:

    - -1: no change to row (like 'dbinsert')
    - 0: add a new value to row (like 'pyexpr')
    - 0.5: replace or remove row (like 'filter')
    - 1: transform whole vector (like 'sort' or 'normalize')
    - 1.5: row to table

    ### rankin=1: consume the rightmost column

    With `rankin=1`, and `rankout` of:

    - -1: no change to row (like 'dbinsert')
    - 0: reduce to scalar (like 'join')
    - 0.5: reduce to simple row (like 'stats')
    - 1: transform whole vector (like 'normalize'); or return None to remove column
    - 1.5: vector to table

    ### rankin=1.5: consume whole table

    With `rankin=2`, and `rankout` of:

    - -1: no change to table
    - 0: reduce table to scalar
    - 0.5: reduce table to single row (like 'collapse')
    - 1: reduce table to single vector ??
    - 1.5: replace table with returned table (like 'sort')

    ## arguments and formatting

    In addition to operands, operators also take parameters, both positional and named (`args` and `kwargs` in Python).
    These cannot have spaces, but they can have Python format strings like `{{input}}`.

    The identifiers available to Python format strings come from a chain of contexts:

    - column names in the current table are replaced with the value in the current row (for rankin=0 or 0.5).
       - from each nested table, in priority from innermost to outermost
    - row will also defer to their "parent" row if they don't have the column

    # Future

    ## new operators

    - `!dbtable`: use entire table as input
    - `!dbquery`: sql template -> table

    ## single-step debugging

    - show results of each step in e.g. VisiData
    - output as Pandas dataframe

    ## simple website scraping

    - recursively apply `!extract-links` and `!fetch-url` to scrape an entire website
      - need operators to remove already-scraped urls and urls outside a particular domain/urlbase
