# Obsidian recipe format below comes from this tutorial: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-as-recipe-manager-and-shopping-list-tutorial/40799
# NB: in order to preserve markdown formatting, a leading space is needed before the # so that aipl doesn't interpret it as a comment string
!format
Here is an Obsidian template I use for recipes:

 ### Recipe Name 

>Notes: 

Time:
Serves:

 ### Ingredients
 #ingredients 
- [x] first ingredient
- [x] second ingredient
- [x] third ingredient

---
 #### Intro:


---
 #### Directions


 #### FINISH:


And here is a poorly typed recipe that I would like you to re-format in the style of the above template please. 
Please put any tips in the Notes section.
Just return the reformatted recipe, no extra words.
